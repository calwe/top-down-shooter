# TopDownShooter

Top Down Shooter project for BNU coursework.

## Build and Run

This project uses Gradle, and the gradlew wrapper is included for convenience. To build and run the project, simply run `./gradlew run` from the project root.

A precompiled jar file is also included (as a GitHub release).

## Note:

We had problems with merging some branches together, so commit authors may be incorrect in places (primarily UI)
